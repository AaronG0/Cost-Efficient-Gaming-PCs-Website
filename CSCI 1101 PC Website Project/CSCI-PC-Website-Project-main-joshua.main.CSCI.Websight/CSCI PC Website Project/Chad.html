                The AMD Ryzen 7600 is the newer generation version of the AMD
                Ryzen 5600 cpu. It has the same 6-cores and 12-threads but is
                able to run at higher speeds. This cpu will outperform its
                previous generation by a good margin and is excellent for the
                price.

                The Gigabyte B650 Gaming X AX motherboard has all the essestials
                that make for a good motherboard that supports the newer
                generation. Compared to the Noob PC, this motherboard has more
                bells and whistles and even a third M.2 NVME drive slot.

                DDR5 ram is the fastest and newest type of ram available and the
                price for this G.skill Flare 32Gb kit is almost unbeatable. The
                6000Mt/s is all the speed one will ever need to play games and
                going higher results in very minimal performance increase.

                This is the same SSD as the Noob PC but with double the storage
                for less than double the price. For a system of this price
                range, a 2Tb SSD is almost a must.

                One of the newest graphics cards released by AMD, the Radeon RX
                7800 XT is considered to be one of the best price-to-performance
                cards in the market. This card can perform with high fps at
                1440p and is backed by the latest technology from AMD. No other
                graphics card at its price point can compete with it.

                This is the same case as the Noob PC and again, cases are the
                most flexible option in building a PC. We recommend this case
                for this build again because it is just that solid and cheap
                while still of good quality.

              <li>
                This PSU is also the same as the Noob PC as it is still able to
                get the job done with a more demanding build. If the PC had more
                demanding parts, we would recommend a higher watt and quality
                PSU. But for this build, this PSU will perform just perfectly.
